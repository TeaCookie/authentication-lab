1. By default drf uses session auth, it stores the session in cookies which are managed by the server. 
You can set the setting in settings.py under default authentication classes.
It stores each session inside the database with expire_date and their keys.

2. Httpie uses basic auth because you put the username and password in the header.

3. In session auth, the server was handling the session. There is information stored on the server side. Stateful.
In token auth, the server didn't need to store anything, Stateless.

4. When you click Log in with Google you grant authorization to the client (bitbucket.org)
The client then sends a authorization request to Google authentication API which then returns a token
The client then uses that token to request data about "ME" from Google's database.
